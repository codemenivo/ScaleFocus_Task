The input.txt file contains a square matrix of integers (2 <n <50).In the first	
row is the dimension of the matrix followed by the elements of the matrix	in rows.
It is necessary to perform "rotation to the right on the diagonals of the matrix".
When rotated to the right,the elements of the main diagonal from the upper half of the matrix 
are moved to the places of the elements of the secondary diagonal in the same rows,
while these are moved to the place of the elements of the main diagonal from the lower part of the matrix to the same columns.
Analogously, the main diagonal elements of the lower half of the matrix are moved to the locations of the secondary diagonal elements in the same rows,
while these are moved to the location	of the main diagonal elements of the upper matrix in the same collumns.
